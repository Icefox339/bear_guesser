You can create your model using data_train.py, actual model is too big to be available on github.
Also, here is a telegram bot with webhooks (I use ngrok to host).
If you need an image validation (in case to prevent all issues with data), you may use data_check.py to valid your images to ensure that script is available to work with them.
